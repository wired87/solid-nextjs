          Support for Botworld services is available solely in English, via email. We do not guarantee any level of support unless specifically outlined in an additional contract or a Service Level Agreement (SLA).

          Botworld utilizes third-party vendors and hosting partners to supply the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to operate the Service.

          You are prohibited from modifying, adapting, or hacking the Service, or from altering any other website to falsely suggest an association with the Service, Botworld, or any other Botworld service.

          You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, or exploit any portion of the Service, its use, or access without explicit written permission from Botworld.

          We reserve the right, though we are not obligated, to remove content and accounts containing material that we, in our sole discretion, deem unlawful, offensive, threatening, libelous, defamatory, pornographic, obscene, or otherwise objectionable or that violates any party's intellectual property or these Terms of Service.

          Any form of verbal, physical, written, or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retribution) directed at any Botworld customer or employee will result in immediate account termination.

          You acknowledge that the technical processing and transmission of the Service, including your content, may involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) modifications to comply with and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.

        <h3>Content Ownership</h3>
        <p>
          Your content remains entirely yours. We do not claim any intellectual property rights over your content and will never sell it to other companies.

          Your content, data sources, and any inputs and outputs by the chatbots will not be used by OpenAI for their AI language models, consistent with their data privacy terms. OpenAI's products, including ChatGPT, will not access or use your data.

          You are solely responsible for your content. You affirm that you possess all necessary rights to all components of your content and that you are not infringing or violating any third party's rights by posting it.

          The AI will utilize the data sources you provide to deliver accurate responses to queries posed by users of your chatbot. Your data will remain private, not shared with other chatbots or customers, and OpenAI will not use any inputs and outputs to train their language models, as mentioned in section 3.2.

          You grant us the permission to publicly display your chatbot, for instance, when you embed the chatbot on your website or share it with others, adhering to the privacy settings you establish for the chatbot.

          Botworld does not screen or approve content.

          Botworld retains the copyright to the design and appearance of the service. While you may retrieve your content at any time, you are prohibited from copying any part of our service’s HTML, CSS, JS, and code frameworks.

          If you publish a testimonial or review about Botworld, either directly or through third-party platforms, you grant us the right to use it for marketing purposes, such as displaying it on our website.

          Any documents you upload as data sources are permanently deleted from our servers once processed. If the document is not processed, for example due to an error, it will automatically be removed from our servers within seven days of upload.        </p>

        <h3>Payment</h3>
        <p>

          Upon upgrading from the free version or trial to any of our paid plans, billing will commence immediately.

          Unless stipulated otherwise, billing cycles are either monthly or annual, with charges applied on or as close as possible to the day of the month or year that you initially upgraded.

          For all payments under $500 per month, payment must be made via credit card through the Botworld website. For higher-tier plans, companies may opt for invoicing, which will be issued regularly. All invoice payments must be completed within 7 days.

          Please note that all fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. You are responsible for the payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties associated with your subscription.

          Should you choose to upgrade your plan during a billing cycle, the credit card on file will be charged immediately with a prorated amount for the remainder of the current billing cycle. In the event of a downgrade, the new plan will be effective from the next billing cycle, and no prorated refund will be issued for any difference in cost. Similarly, if a plan is cancelled partway through a billing cycle, no prorated refund will be provided for the remaining days, unless the cancellation occurs within the refund period specified in our Refund Policy.

          We strive to process refunds fairly, taking into consideration your usage of the service.
        </p>

        <h3>Cancelation</h3>
        <p>
          You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. Please note that requests to cancel your account via email or phone are not recognized as valid cancellations. You can cancel your subscription at any time by navigating to the Billing & Usage page in your account and clicking the red “Cancel subscription” button.

          Upon cancellation, all of your content will be scheduled for deletion shortly after your subscription ends. Once deleted, this information cannot be recovered.

          If you cancel your service before the end of your billing cycle, your subscription will remain active until the end of that period. After this point, your account will be terminated, and you will not be billed further unless you choose to reactivate your subscription.

          Botworld reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any current or future use of our services for any reason at any time. Such actions will result in the deactivation or deletion of your account and the forfeiture of all content contained within it. We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

          In instances where Botworld decides to suspend or terminate an account, we will endeavor to provide the affected account owner with a copy of their account contents upon request, provided the account was not suspended or terminated due to unlawful activity.
        </p>
        <h3>Services and Pricing</h3>
        <p>
          Botworld reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof). This includes the ability to change the prices of our services, such as monthly and annual subscription fees, at any time. This policy is applicable to new, free, and trial customers.

          Botworld shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modifications, price changes, suspensions, or discontinuations of the service. Changes will be implemented at our discretion and could affect various aspects of the service, including but not limited to availability and pricing structures.
